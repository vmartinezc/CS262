 Study the lab starter code and answer the following questions.

a. How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented?
There is 1 API endpoint this application supports that is implemented on line 122 of the pom.xml

b. PlayerResource.java
  i.What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?
  JBC 
  ii.Compare and contrast the following:
      1. SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects
      JDBC statement objects need to get each data table as a list of rows (Players in this case) and need more work to go
      into finding data you want vs. SQL query statements which are very simple.
      2. SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
      SQL relations return tables of tuples while List<Player> is a list of java objects, and the JDBC
      result set is a list of tuples with data.

  iii.Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?
  getValueStringOrNull() would be used whenever the user wants to display something that could potentially be NULL.
  In PlayerResource.java it's  being used to retrieve and display the player's name.

c.Player.java
    i.What purpose does this Player DAO serve?
    Provides an object-oriented way to represent and manipulate player "objects"
    from the traditional (non-object-oriented) Monopoly base.
    ii. How does it compare with the Player table?
    In the player table we don't have any methods. Rather, we use queries to get
    the data. Player DAO serve does have different methods that can be implemented
    in a object-oriented fashion.

-- EXERCISE 8.1
--- a. List of all games, ordered by date starting from the most recent
SELECT * FROM GAME
ORDER BY time ASC;


--- b. Retrieve all the games that occurred in the past week
--SELECT * FROM GAME

SELECT * FROM GAME WHERE time >= '2018-10-14 00:00:00'
ORDER BY time DESC;
 
--- c. Retrieve a list of players who have a (non-NULL) names

SELECT * FROM PLAYER WHERE name <> NULL; 


--- d. Retrieve a list of IDs of players who have some score larger than 2000
SELECT playerID FROM PlayerGame where score > 2000;



----- e. Retrieve a list of players who have a GMAIL account
SELECT * FROM Player where emailAddress LIKE '%gmail%';




----- EXERCISE 8.2 
--- MULTIPLE-TABLE QUERIES
-- a. Retrieve all "The King"'s game scores in decreasing order
SELECT score
FROM Player, PlayerGame
WHERE Player.ID = PlayerGame.playerID
AND Player.name = 'The King' 
ORDER BY score DESC;

--- b. Retrieve the name of the winner of the game played on 2006-06-28 13:20:00
SELECT name 
FROM Game, Player, PlayerGame
WHERE Game.time = '2006-06-28 13:20:00'
AND Game.ID = PlayerGame.GameID
AND PlayerGame.playerID = player.ID
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 1;


---- c.So what does that P1.ID < P2.ID clause do in the last example query? 
---- If the players share the same name, then it(p1.id <p2.id) makes sure that the p1 and the p2 don't have the same ID 
----- and it also checks if one id is greater than the other one 


------- d. The query that joined the Player table to itself seems rather contrived. Can you think of a realistic situation in which youâ€™d want to join a table to itself? 
--------- We would like to join a table to itself when we want to compare how often an event happens involving the same part of a table. For example, if I want to know how
--------- many time player1 won over player2, we would use the query SELECT P1.name, FROM Player AS P1, Player AS P2 ...
